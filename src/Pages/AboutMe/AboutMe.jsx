          Hi, I'm <strong>Ajay Krishna Reddy</strong>, a 25-year-old from Narasaraopet, now in Palnadu district, Andhra Pradesh, born on <strong>September 29, 1998</strong>.
          I graduated from PRIST Deemed University in Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

          To pursue this, I developed platforms like <strong>Scamsters</strong> to expose frauds, and <strong>Where is My Foreman</strong> to support skilled workers. 
          My goal is to see my country progress from a developing stage to a developed stage.

          However, Iâ€™ve faced too many challenges in getting clients.
        </p>
